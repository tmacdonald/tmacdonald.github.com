#Backbone Subviews

Something I've noticed bouncing around the Backbone community these days is the idea of how to structure subviews. I'm going to outline here a basic example of how I look to include subviews.

In this example, we have two Backbone Views: ParentView and ChildView.

	var ParentView = Backbone.View.extend({
		
	});

	var ChildView = Backbone.View.extend({
		
	});
